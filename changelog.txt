Version 2.0.0

- Introduction of modules system. SplitRankings turned into a module.
- Module SplitRankings: Add fighter/atttacker/bomber rankings to VLife page.
- Module SplitRankings: Jabo sorties (e.g. a jabo FW-190) now contribute to attacker rating. Me-262 and P-38 sorties without bombs contribute to fighter ratings (they both used to be considered attackers).
- New module: Ammo Breakdown. See which shots you hit, and which shots you got hit by in indivual sortie pages.
- New module: Ironman Stats. A new table which shows you how your current pilot life stacks up against all other current pilot lives. Your stats on this page reset when your pilot dies!
- Display more information on VLife page. E.g. your kills/per aircraft lost.
- Update to version 1.2.49 of IL-2 Stats.

Version 2.0.1

- Fix CSS issue with VLife page. Now "KDR", "Ratio" and so on are correctly rendered.

Version 2.0.2

- Update Spanish localization.

Version 2.0.3

- Fix bug where "Best Fighter/Attacker pilot in the last 24 hours" was not properly counting jabo flights towards attacker pilots.

Version 2.1.0

- Add new module 'undamaged_bailout_penalty' - If a player bails out without having any damage taken, then he loses up to (by default, this is configurable in the admin panel) 100 score, and 20 fairplay. This is to incentivize players to fight instead of bailing out at the first sign of trouble.
- Add new module 'flight_time_bonus' - Gives (by default, this is configurable in the admin panel) players one extra point for every minute the player is in the air. This is to encourge players to run CAP over areas which might not see the most action.
- Add new module 'adjustable_bonuses_penalties' - Lets you adjust percent penalties/bonuses for sorties. Bonuses for landing, being in flight, being in winning coalation. Penalties for dying, getting captured, bailing out, or getting shotdown. Defaults as in combat box. Encourges players to stay as alive as possible.

Version 2.1.1

- Fix an incorrect Russian translation.

Version 2.1.2

- Update to 1.2.50 of IL2 Stats.

Version 2.1.3

- Fix bug where not having adjustabe scores and penalties module caused an infinite recursion when trying to process stats.

Version 2.1.4

- Fix bug where stats process would sometimes hang on ammo breakdown.

Version 2.1.5

- Fix malformed base.html

Version 2.1.6

- Improve performance of ironman rankings table. In previous tours, currently multiple VLifes for a single player are shown. Finding the best one for each player was taking too long.
- Fix bug in ironman rankings table where dead VLives were being shown in current tour (your best streak was displayed on current tour and not just in previous ones).

Version 2.2.0

- Add Portuguese translations.
- Module Ammo Breakdown: Try to figure out which ammo caused damage in a "damage/damaged" line and display the guess in sortie logs.
- Module SplitRankings: Completely seperate fighter/attacker/personas. Now every field in your player profile can be seen seperately for fighter/attacker/bomber types. For example, check your K/D when flying with only fighters, or your GK/HR when you fly attacker types. This also works with the ironman rankings module.
- Module SplitRankings: Now consider some attacker aircraft sorties towards fighter rating. Those sorties with more air kills and air assist together than ground kills are counted towards fighter rating. Recent history of the player is taken into account in case of ambiguous sorties.
- Module SplitRankings: Reset fighter/attacker/bomber streaks only when you die in the corresponding type. This applies to the main page of the website (best living fighter/attacker/bomber pilots).
- New module "Top Last Mission", which replaces top of last 24 hours with top player in the last mission. Mainly meant for event servers where the action doesn't happen 24/7.
- New module "Rearm Accuracy Workaround", which stops sorties where a player took off twice (and thus presumambly rearmed) from being counted towards player accuracy. The total nr shots fired is reset when you rearm in the logs, and there is no way to recover how many shots you fired before the rearm. This is a workaround whichs bandaids the problem.
- New module "Bailout Accuracy Workaround", which stops sorties where a player bailed out from being counted towards player accuracy. The number of shots is set to the max possible (= how many shots you started with) in sorties where you bailout, and again it is a bug in the game logs, and as such impossible to count the number of shots. This is a workaround whichs bandaids the problem.

Version 2.2.1

- Fix bug where damaged sortie logs without attached hits were causing a 500 error in pilot sortie logs.

Version 2.2.2

- Fix bug where not all sorties with bombs/rockets as fighter were being recognized as attackers. For example FW 190 A8 with side bombs only, or Hurricanes with bombs.

Version 2.2.3

- Fix bug introduced in last version where all modifications were being recognized as attacker modifications.

Version 2.2.4

- Disambiguate the two bullet types shot from small caliber brownings - ".303 British" and ".30-06 Springfield".

Version 2.3.0

- New module "Mission Win New Tour", which starts new a new tour every time a mission is won.

Version 2.3.1

- Update to 1.2.57 of IL2 Stats.

Version 2.3.2

- Module Ammo breakdown: Fix rare bug where stats parser would crash if there was a hit registered in the DServer logs with a bullet/shell projectile that did not have an attacker.

Version 2.3.3

- Update to 1.2.59 of IL2 Stats.

Version 2.4.0

- New module "Air streaks no AI", makes air streaks not count ai kills.
- New module "Gunnery stats", which includes a new table "Gunner Rankings" which works like "Pilot rankings", but for gunners of an aircraft.
- Module Ammo Breakdown: The breakdowns now also work for bombs/rockets. This is useful for attacker/bomber planes, and also works for tanks (bombs/rockets taken).
- Fix bug where sorties were being counted twice for specialized VLives (fighter/attacker/bomber vlives). Happened only if mission was declared to be "won by score".
